When considering effective liquidity pools between two consecutive 4-hour candles, the distribution of liquidity depends on several factors derived from **market theory** and the principle of **efficient markets**. Let's break it down:

### **Market Theory: Liquidity Attraction**
1. **Most Recent Candle**:
   - **Attractiveness**: The most recent candle generally attracts more attention because:
     - It's closer to the current market action, making it more "relevant" to traders.
     - Retail traders and algorithms often use the highs and lows of the most recent candles for stop placements and trade triggers.
   - **Traders' Behavior**:
     - Stops for breakout traders or pending orders for reversals are likely clustered near these levels.
   - **Institutional Behavior**:
     - Institutions might target the most recent liquidity pool first to fill large orders, as it’s less risky than venturing into older, less active levels.

2. **Farthest Candle**:
   - **Attractiveness**: The farther candle can still hold significant liquidity, especially if:
     - Its high or low coincides with a major price level (e.g., round numbers, previous day's high/low, or session highs/lows).
     - It was the extreme point of a strong move or aligns with key technical indicators like Fibonacci retracement levels.
   - **Dormancy Risk**:
     - Liquidity at the farthest candle might diminish over time as participants adjust their stops and positions in response to more recent price action.

3. **Both Candles**:
   - **Liquidity Pools Overlap**:
     - If the highs/lows of both candles are close together, liquidity may concentrate in that range, making it a high-value target.
     - Markets tend to gravitate toward such "stacked liquidity zones."

### **Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) Perspective**
1. **Recent Candle High/Low**:
   - In an efficient market, participants continuously update their expectations based on new information.
   - Therefore, recent highs/lows are more likely to reflect current market sentiment and attract higher liquidity.

2. **Farther Candle High/Low**:
   - These levels might reflect older market sentiment and hold less relevance unless they align with longer-term support/resistance or are part of a larger trend.

### **Scenarios Where Each Attracts Liquidity**

#### **Scenario 1: Trending Market**
- **Most Recent Candle Attracts More Liquidity**:
  - In a trend, traders focus on the most recent highs/lows as potential breakout or retracement levels.
  - Farthest candle levels may be ignored unless they align with the trend’s broader structure.

#### **Scenario 2: Range-Bound Market**
- **Both Candles Can Attract Liquidity**:
  - In ranges, highs and lows of multiple candles become liquidity pools as traders place stops and pending orders at both ends of the consolidation.

#### **Scenario 3: News/Volatility Event**
- **Farthest Candle Might Attract More Liquidity**:
  - A significant move caused by news or volatility may "reach back" to liquidity in farther candles if these levels align with major institutional zones.

### **Key Determinants of Liquidity Pool Effectiveness**

1. **Volume Profile**:
   - Analyze where the highest volume traded within the candles. Liquidity often clusters near high-volume areas.

2. **Market Participation**:
   - Liquidity pools are dynamic and depend on the time of day (e.g., overlapping London/New York sessions) and the type of participants active in the market.

3. **Time Decay**:
   - Liquidity at farthest candles decays unless reinforced by structural significance.

4. **Technical Alignment**:
   - The likelihood of liquidity being targeted increases when candle highs/lows align with:
     - Key Fibonacci levels.
     - Trendlines.
     - Major support/resistance zones.

### **Conclusion: Which Attracts More Liquidity?**

- **The Most Recent Candle** typically holds more immediate liquidity because it reflects the most current trader behavior and market sentiment.
- **The Farthest Candle** still holds relevance if:
  - It represents a key swing high/low.
  - It coincides with significant price levels or institutional zones.

In an **efficient market**, the order of targeting liquidity pools is often based on proximity, relevance, and alignment with the market's structural objectives. However, it's crucial to evaluate both candles' levels in the context of the broader market environment and confluence factors to make an informed decision.
